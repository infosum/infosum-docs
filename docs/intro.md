# Intro

Welcome to the [InfoSum](https://www.infosum.com) Developer Documentation. If you require information on how the [InfoSum Platform](https://www.platform.infosum.com) works you may want to check out the [Help Centre](https://support.infosum.com), which contains in-depth information on all aspects of the Platform.

## Creating an InfoSum Account

Before you can get an API Key to use with the platform you will need to be registered as a user on the [InfoSum Platform](https://www.platform.infosum.com). Please [Contact Us](https://www.infosum.com/company/contact) in order to request a demo and get in touch. 

## API Versions

InfoSum currently supports two API versions in parallel. They both share the same authentication mechanism and v2 tokens are valid for both APIs.

The v1 API was created specifically for executing queries and activating the results using datasets which have already been created in the platform via the UI and the [relevant permissions](https://support.infosum.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019049798-Permissions-overview) granted between all collaborators.

The v2 API is the next generation of APIs from InfoSum and is in active development covering all new features. The v2 API will eventually cover all aspects of platform usage. If you are unsure about if you have access to the features covered in the v2 API then please contact to your InfoSum customer success representative.
