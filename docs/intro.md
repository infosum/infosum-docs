# Intro

Welcome to the [InfoSum](https://www.infosum.com) Developer Documentation. If you require information on how the [InfoSum Platform](https://www.platform.infosum.com) works you should visit our [Help Centre](https://support.infosum.com), which contains in-depth information on all aspects of the Platform.

## Creating an InfoSum Account

Before you can get an API Key to use with the platform you will need to be registered as a user on the [InfoSum Platform](https://www.platform.infosum.com). Please [Contact Us](https://www.infosum.com/company/contact) or your Customer Success representative if you need help accessing the platform.

## API Versions

InfoSum currently supports two API versions in parallel. They both share the same authentication mechanism and v2 tokens are valid for both APIs.

The v1 API was created specifically for executing queries and activating the results using datasets which have already been created in the platform via the UI and the [relevant permissions](https://support.infosum.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019049798-Permissions-overview) granted between all collaborators.

The v2 API is the next generation of APIs from InfoSum and is in active development covering all new features. The v2 API will eventually cover all aspects of platform usage. If you are unsure about if you have access to the features covered in the v2 API then please contact to your InfoSum customer success representative.

To use the API each user must create an API key. You can use this article to learn [how to generate API keys](https://support.infosum.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018850497-Accessing-the-API#h_01JBBT9BG3D0V2AFWGDBJT9YYF). You will need to generate the API V2 key for data onboarding. All endpoints, V1 & V2, use V2 API keys.

## API Playbooks

InfoSum currently supports a collection of their APIs packaged for new & advanced users of InfoSum for users looking to begin leveraging InfoSum's API suite. The best use cases are for users who want to improve operational efficiency and enhance their business current capabilities.

We currently offer the following playbooks:

- [Onboarding Data](https://infosum.github.io/infosum-docs/api/ActivationDestination)
- [Activation Queries & Pushing to a Destination](https://infosum.github.io/infosum-docs/api/ActivationDestination)
