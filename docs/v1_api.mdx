# V1 API

The InfoSum v1 API has everything you need to run regular queries and push activation results to your destination via a push connector. It is stable, but being superseded by the v2 API which will cover all aspects of platform usage.

The v1 API is ideal if you already have a bunker in the InfoSum Platform and want to run queries on a regular cadence.

Visit the [REST API Reference Documentation](/api/v1) to explore the available endpoints.

## Authentication

In order to get started building with the v1 API you first need to generate a v1 API key via the Platform UI which consists of a public-private key pair.

<Admonition type="note">
You must provide your v1 API public-private keypair in the authorization header for all API requests to `/api/v1` paths in the format `<public_token>/<private_token>`.
</Admonition>

Head to the [API Access Keys](https://accounts.infosum.com/access/api-keys) page in your [InfoSum Account](https://accounts.infosum.com/). It appears in the sidebar navigation under **Access &rarr; API Keys**.

If you have previously generated keys you will see them listed here. If not you will see the following screen:

<img src={NoAPIKeysImageURL} class="image_md"/><p/>
Select **NEW API KEY** and you will be given a date selector for the expiry date for the new API key:

<img src={SetExpiryImageURL} class="center_half_image"/><p/>
On submitting the expiry time you will be given your API key in the form of a **public** and **private** key:

<img src={GrantedAPIKeysImageURL} class="center_half_image"/><p/>
Please store the **private** key safely for later use. After you close this pop-up, you will not be able to view the private key again.
