# Authentication

The InfoSum APIs require an `API Key` that is used as part of the `Authorization` header.

## Where to get an API Key

Once you have created an InfoSum account and have the [relevant permissions](https://support.infosum.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019049798-Permissions-overview). You can head to https://accounts.infosum.com/access/api-keys.

## How to generate a key

If you have previously generated keys you will see them listed here. If not you will see the following screen:

![No API Keys Generated](/img/authentication/no-api-keys.png)

Select `NEW API KEY` on the page and you will be given a date selector for the expiry date of the `API Key` like so:

![Select an expiry date for the expiry key](/img/authentication/set-api-key-expiry.png)

When that is successful you will be given your `API Key` in the form of a `public` and `private` key:

Please store the `private` key safely for later use. After you close this pop-up, you will not be able to view the private key again.
