# Authentication

In order to get started building with the InfoSum APIs you first need to generate an API token via the Platform UI.

<Admonition type="note">
You must provide your API token in the authorization header for all API requests to `/api/` paths.
</Admonition>

Head to the [API Access Keys](https://accounts.infosum.com/access/api-keys-v2) page in your [InfoSum Account](https://accounts.infosum.com/). It appears in the sidebar navigation under **Access &rarr; API Keys V2**.

<Admonition type="note">
V1 Access Keys are deprecated. Please use v2 Access keys for both `/api/v1` and `/api/v2` paths.
</Admonition>

If you have previously generated keys you will see them listed here. If not you will see the following screen:

<img src={NoAPIKeysImageURL}/><p/>
Select **NEW API KEY** and you will be given a date selector for the expiry date for the new API token:

<img src={SetExpiryImageURL} className="center_half_image" /><p/>
On submitting the expiry time you will be given your API Key Token:

<img src={GrantedAPIKeysImageURL} className="center_half_image"/><p/>
Please store your API Key Token safely for later use. After you close this pop-up, you will not be able to view the key token again.
