## Authentication

To use the InfoSum APIs you will need an `API Key`. To generate an API for use in your application you can [follow these instructions](/docs/authentication).

For simplicity in the next steps, we will assign the `API Key` to an `environment` variable as shown:

```bash
export INFOSUM_API_KEY="<your generated API key>";
```
