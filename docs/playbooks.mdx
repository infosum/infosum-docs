# API Playbooks

InfoSum currently supports a collection of their APIs packaged for new & advanced users of InfoSum for users looking to begin leveraging InfoSum's API suite. The best use cases are for users who want to improve operational efficiency and enhance their business current capabilities.

We currently offer the following playbooks:
- Onboarding Data
- Activation Queries & Pushing to a Destination

### [Onboarding Data](https://infosum.github.io/infosum-docs/api/Onboarding)
The goal of data onboarding is publishing a standardized and encrypted version of your data to a Bunker (called dataset in the platform), an isolated cloud instance that can be permissioned for collaboration. Onboarding happens in a file management staging environment called Cloud Vault. Once all onboarding tasks are completed, the data will be available in your Bunker. The onboarding API reuses saved configurations across each onboarding task to perform the import on a set schedule. This means that data onboarding always needs to happen manually first. **We ask that your team performs the initial end-to-end data onboarding via the UI to set up the configurations, as this will provide clear context and significantly simplify the automated API setup.** 


### [Activation Queries & Pushing to a Destination](https://infosum.github.io/infosum-docs/api/ActivationDestination)
The goal of activating data and pushing to a destination is to recieve (or send) intersected data outside of InfoSum. You will run an activation query and then push the result to any one of our destinations. These include: [DV360, Amazon Ads, TikTok, The Trade Desk, and more!](https://support.infosum.com/hc/en-us/articles/12128356485778-Supported-Destinations-for-Activation)
