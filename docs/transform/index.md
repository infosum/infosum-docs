# Transformations

The Transformations Service is an ETL (Expand, Transform, Load) system based upon [Benthos](https://www.benthos.dev/). The language used by Benthos to do transformations is called `bloblang`.

Transform blends datasets in any format, size or system into a consistent set of data that can be interpreted by the Platform. Transform applies aggregation, concatenation and union processes to a data file (or group of data files) to create one or more transform SDF files.

For a complete guide to `bloblang` and how to transform data, please refer to the [Benthos documentation](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/guides/bloblang/about).
