# Transformations

The Transformations Service is an ETL (Expand, Transform, Load) system based upon [Benthos](https://www.benthos.dev/), and the language used by Benthos to do transformations is called `bloblang`.

## Bloblang
For a complete guide to `bloblang` and how to transform data, please refer to the [Benthos documentation](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/guides/bloblang/about).
